# Random-Face-Generation-Using-GAN
This project focuses on utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for the creative task of generating random anime faces. GANs are a powerful class of deep learning models known for their ability to generate realistic data. In this context, the GAN will be trained on a dataset comprising anime character images.
